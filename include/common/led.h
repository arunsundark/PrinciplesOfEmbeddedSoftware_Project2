/**
 @brief Function to initialize the RGB LED on FRDM board
 Initializes the onboard RGB LED. The pins sink current hence setting the bits turn the LED OFF
 writing high to a bit in PCOR port clear output register clears that bit in the PDOR and turns ON the LED
writing high to a bit in PSOR port set output register sets that bit in the PDOR and turns OFF the LED
These have been setup as macros above.
 @param None
 @return None
